To use Dash, we need the following packages: dash, dash-renderer, dash-html-components, dash-core-components, and plotly. These packages also have various dependencies.

Dash Installation
In your terminal, install several dash libraries. These libraries are under active development, so install and upgrade frequently. Python 2 and 3 are supported.
