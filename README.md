# Task-1

This is a  sentiment analysis application with Dash and Python. This is a code  to build live-updating graph of Twitter sentiment for a term that we choose.We can use any term such as “Donald Trump” or any other popular term in Twitter. For this we will use the term “Bitcoin” .To do this, all I am going to do is take our updates and apply them to the Live graph.


Matplotlib is a fine graphing library, and is the backend to many other packages that allow you to graph, such as Pandas' .plot() method.

The Python library Dash, from Plot.ly, which helps us to build web-based data visualization interfaces by tying together Plot.ly, React, and Flask.

To use Dash, we need the following packages: dash, dash-renderer, dash-html-components, dash-core-components, and plotly. These packages also have various dependencies.
